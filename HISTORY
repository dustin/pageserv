module configs all moved under modules.*

debugging should now be done via the _ndebug macro, which takes two
arguments, the debug level, and the arguments to pass to printf

--------------------

This isn't much of a history, but it may be if we start using it.

    I'm working on SQL based user and terminal databases right now using
PostgreSQL.  Potentially, any RDBMS that uses SQL could work, but I'm
using Postgres because it's the best.  :)

--------------------

    The first major change I made after release_2_9_3 I made consisted of
configuration file movement.  This is very important:

    etc.userdb and etc.termdb are now databases.userdb and
    databases.termdb respectively

Please update your local configs for this, you can use the included
sample for reference.

    Also, databases.nis_userdb and nis_termdb have been removed for the
more generic databases.userdbType and databases.termdbType.  These now
use a string as an argument, and it is matched against known database
types.  The term database info is currently ignored.

--------------------

As of release_2_9_3, there are multiple developers, starting with
spberry@iastate.edu
