# Terminal number - flags - terminal server - port - pre-dial
# all delimited by ws

# terminal number is the key for the database, and is the number the
# modem will dial to deliver pages.
#
# flags are generally useless, but are sometimes useful for tweaking
# against terminals that don't properly comply to protocol standards.
#
# 1 causes an initial CR to be sent upon connection.  This isn't really
# required (the spec says it should be there, but it can exist without
# it), but it causes around a couple seconds of delay on init if it's not
# here.  I've had terminals get really confused with its presence,
# though.  Generally, I'd recommend this flag unless it causes problems.
# If 1 is used, then 2 can be used to attempt an ititial delay before
# trying an init CR.
#
# The third field is for the terminal server or device to communicate
# with.
#
# The port number is required for terminal server devices, and ignored
# for UNIX devices.
#
# predial is in case you need to dial 9 to get out or something.  You can
# see here that I've got entries that use different terminal servers
# and devices that I've used in the past, once I had to start delivering
# pages in Little Rock, AR out of Fort Smith, AR because of a broken
# terminal server
