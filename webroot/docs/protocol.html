<h2>Original Protocol information</h2>

This is the module that includes support for the original pager protocol.
It was more BBS like than protocol like, but I was young then, and hadn't
read enough RFCs.  :)  This module is by default configured to run on
port 1029.  Although this module has been mostly pulled out of the
internals as to behave like a normal module, it's still a little tied up.
I haven't bothered supporting it too much, and haven't cared to make
changes to it, thus don't reccommend using it if you can avoid it.
<p>
This a (possibly) complete list of the command supported in this module.
Its functionality is being mostly replaced by the <a href="http.html">
web server</a> for general management and the <a href="snpp.html">
SNPP server</a> for flexibility in queuing pages.

<ul>
    <li><a href="#epage">epage</a></li>
    <li><a href="#mash">mash</a></li>
    <li><a href="#farkle">farkle</a> *</li>
    <li><a href="#depth">depth</a></li>
    <li><a href="#quit">quit</a></li>
</ul>

<font size="-1">
* Note, farkle is optional, and will hopefully always be configured out
in the future.

<a name="epage"></a>

<h3>epage</h3>
epage is the normal method for delivering pages.  It's fairly
self-explanatory

<a name="mash"></a>

<h3>mash</h3>
mash was added for backward compatibility.  It's a simpler form of epage,
and will hopefully be removed someday.

<a name="farkle"></a>

<h3>farkle</h3>
farkle is part of the old delivery system.  It can be (and is by default)
configured out as it is somewhat destructive and doesn't provide for
reliable page delivery.

<a name="depth"></a>

<h3>depth</h3>
The depth command, of course, returns the depth of the queue.  This
command is unique to this protocol, and currently this is the only
way to find out this information remotely.  There will probably be
something integrated into the webserver to do this before too long, but
it's not a very high priority.

<a name="quit"></a>

<h3>quit</h3>
quit simply quits.  It's useful for monitors and such as I have that hit
a port and just send ``quit'' verifying that something is listening on the
port, or if you're asleep and accidentally hit the wrong port, you have a
clean way out.
