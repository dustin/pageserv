<h2>Protocol information</h2>

<a name="#epage"></a>

<h3>epage</h3>
epage is the normal method for delivering pages.  It's fairly
self-explanatory

<a name="#mash"></a>

<h3>mash</h3>
mash was added for backward compatibility.  It's a simpler form of epage,
and will hopefully be removed someday.

<a name="#farkle"></a>

<h3>farkle</h3>
farkle is part of the old delivery system.  It can be (and is by default)
configured out as it is somewhat destructive and doesn't provide for
reliable page delivery.

<a name="#depth"></a>

<h3>depth</h3>
The depth command, of course, returns the depth of the queue.

<a name="#quit"></a>

<h3>quit</h3>
quit simply quits.  It's useful for monitors and such as I have that hit
a port and just send ``quit'' verifying that something is listening on the
port, or if you're asleep and accidentally hit the wrong port, you have a
clean way out.
