<h2>SNPP Level 1 in the SNPP module</h2>

Pageserv fully supports SNPP level 1 transactions.  For more information,
please read <a href="rfc1861.html">RFC 1861</a>.  I will discuss only
specifics here.

<p>

The PAGEr command from RFC 1861 says that the SNPP server itself can
optionally verfiy the id sent, and I do.  A page can only be queued if
it's to a user listed in the database.  These usernames can be made up of
a combination any letters and/or numbers, i.e. if you wanted to send a
page to me on my home system, it would need to be queued to the user
``dustin'' (without the quotes obviously).
<p>
Another part of the RFC that was left up to the implementation was
supporting multiple recipients per message.  This is supported in my
pager server.  For instance, this example is what it would look like if
someone wanted to send a single message to a lot of recipients:

<pre>
220 Dustin's SNPP gateway version $version ready
page randomboyx
250 Pager ID Accepted
page randomgirlx
250 Pager ID Accepted
page randomboyy
550 No such user
page randomboy_y
250 Pager ID Accepted
page randomgirl_y
250 Pager ID Accepted
message Hi everybody!
250 Message OK
send
250 Message queued successfully
quit
221 Alrighty, then, goodbye
</pre>

In the previous example, user randomboyy failed because he didn't exist
in the user database, but the rest of the users were kept up with (no
need to RESEt).  It's possible to receive a ``554 Message failed'' if any
one of the per-user tests failed (bad time for a normal priority page,
etc...), however, the page will still be delivered to valid recipients.
I will probably change this behavior in the future, so it's not a good
idea to rely on it.

<h2>SNPP Level 2 in pageserv</h2>

The only level two command supported in this release is HOLDuntil.

<h2>Custon SNPP commands</h2>

I had to add a new command ``PRIORITY'' to be able to set priorities to
pages being sent out.  This commands affects all page recipients (whether
you've defined them yet is irrelevant).  An example command to set the
priority to high, default is normal:

<pre>
priority high
</pre>
