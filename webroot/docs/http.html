<h2>HTPP</h2>

Pageserv supports HTPP for most simple web services.  There's not a lot to
document here from the user end since the content of the web root really
defines what's in it, but there are a couple things that should be noted.

<h2>MIME Types</h2>

Pageserv's http module presently has no concept of mime types, instead, it
just sends everything out as text/html.  This isn't *really* a problem, as
pageserv shouldn't be used as a real web server, but it'd be nice to toss
a graphic or something in here (or a text file for the RFCs), so it should
be implemented eventually.

<h2>Server Parsing</h2>

There is simple server parsing that is subject to go through drastic changes
before turning into whatever it will be.  The following variables can be
included in a document:

<ul>
   <li>$<code>version</code></li>
   <li>$<code>user</code></li>
</ul>

Which will print out the current server version and authenticated username
respectively.

<p>

There's also functions (which really don't have much of a distinction yet,
as you can't pass arguments to them), which include the following:

<ul>
    <li>&<code>selectTimeE</code></li>
    <li>&<code>selectTimeL</code></li>
    <li>&<code>selectListTerms</code></li>
    <li>&<code>tableUserList</code></li>
</ul>

The first two, &<code>selectTimeE</code> and &<code>selectTimeL</code>, return
a select input list for the early and late normal priority times for the
currently authenticated user.

<p>

&<code>selectListTerms</code> produces a select input list for all known
terminal servers.

<p>

&<code>tableUserList</code> produces an HTML table including all users and
their information.
