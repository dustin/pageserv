<h2>Welcome Pageserv Developer</h2>

Hey, developers.  Want some of your code to run inside of my pager
server?  No problem, there's now a (kind of) simple interface for adding
modules to the pager server.

<p>

I've created what's nearly an OO interface so that each module becomes
sort of an object that gets loaded upon initialization.  Each module
should have an initialization function, a handler function, and a socket
return function so that we can get stuff going and find out information
about it.  The module typedef looks like this:

<pre>
typedef struct {
    void (*init)(void);
    void (*handler)(modpass in);

    int (*socket)(void);

    char *name;

    int listening;
    int s;
} module;
</pre>

Upon initializing, the initmodules() routine goes through the list of
compiled in modules and creates a copy of each module into a globally
accessable structure element.  Realize, of course, that this means the
<i>actual</i> data in the real module is completely inaccessible, the OO
equivelant of private data, however, the methods involved in extracting
or modifying that data don't move, so it's easy to keep up with the
functions that modify the data without other random functions breaking
the data.

<p>

When initializing the daemon, it loops through all of the compiled-in
modules and calls their initialization routine, then makes a call to its
socket() routine to see if it returns a positive value, if it does, then
it selects on the value that it returned and calls the handler with a
modpass p (which for now only contains the newly formed socket) when a
connection comes in on its id.

<p>

This id, of course, can be any valid file descriptor, as the main server
itself doesn't do anything with it but pass it off to the handler.
