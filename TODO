Overall:

    * Make compliant with SNPP (RFC1861)
    * Add signal trapping for server to clean up pid file and manually
      free memory, possibly one to reload the config too, why not?
    * Queue expiration
    * Queue postponing

Delivery:

    * Internalize delivery and remove farkle protocol command
    * Local modem support

Clients:

    * Cleaner client stuff
    * use getopt() in pushqueue code, I already know if I've got it,
      might as well use it.
    * CGI client
