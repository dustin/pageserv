Overall:

    * Configuration for logging
    * Bigger queue files (connect from where, etc...)
    * hosts.access
    * Completely internal delivery stuff (no need for -bq all the time)
    * Management login to manage crap
    * NIS based databases
    * support numeric pagers

Delivery:

    * Some sort of delivery locking, or file locking, or something so running
      -bq twice at the same time won't give you two copies of your pages.
    * check time at delivery time in case a message has been stuck
    * have timeouts actually time out
    * Local modem support
    * clean stuff

Clients:

    * Cleaner client stuff
    * Add more options to clients: remote host, options to parsemail,
      etc...
    * Enhance web listener (password auth for logins)
