    * Management login to manage crap

    * support numeric pagers
    * make it so that I can run the server as root to get secure ports, but
      it actually serves as a pager user of some sort

Delivery:

    * multiple modems on a port
    * have timeouts actually time out
    * clean stuff

Clients:

    * Add more options to clients: remote host, options to parsemail,
      etc...

      There.
    * Automate module adding.
