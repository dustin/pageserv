    * Management login to manage crap
    * NIS based databases
    * support numeric pagers
    * make it so that I can run the server as root to get secure ports, but
      it actually serves as a pager user of some sort

    * have timeouts actually time out
    * clean stuff
    * Device locking

    * Cleaner client stuff
    * Add more options to clients: remote host, options to parsemail,
      etc...
    * Enhance web listener (password auth for logins)
    * .parsemail

Technical:

      There.
